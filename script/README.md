## Data Analysis Using R
The data available in the data folder contains data for male and female mice, but preliminary data 
has indicated that there may be differences based on sex, so these data are first separated into 
male and female. As of 04/07/2023 the R code has a draft figure featuring the female mice. 
Moving forward, the mean and standard deviation will be evaluated, outliers will be exposed, and 
an ANOVA statistical test will be run on the data.
